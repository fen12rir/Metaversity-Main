## 💡 Talking Points

### Problem Being Solved
"In the Philippines, millions volunteer in their communities—cleaning streets, tutoring kids, helping during disasters. But when they apply for jobs or scholarships, there's no way to prove it. Bayanika makes community work verifiable and rewarding."

### How It Works
"Users join activities, complete them, and submit proof. Admins verify the work and award points. These points can be redeemed for real rewards. Plus, each verified contribution becomes an NFT on Base blockchain—a permanent, verifiable credential."

### Why It Matters
"This incentivizes community participation, recognizes volunteers, and creates verifiable credentials that can be used for career advancement. It's Bayanihan meets Web3."

### Technical Highlights
"Built with Remix for optimal performance, integrated with Base for on-chain verification, and designed with Filipino users in mind. The entire flow is seamless—from joining an activity to redeeming rewards."
